Customers can mark their location  on google map and address will be automatically populated.
== Description ==

The WooCommerce Map to Address Plugin enables customers to retrieve their current address from Google Maps and automatically populate the shipping address field on the WooCommerce checkout page. so then is also referred to as the Shipping Address Automation plugin.

This WooCommerce Map to Address Plugin utilizes reverse geocoding. When a customer selects their location, the plugin uses the map coordinates and applies reverse geocoding to populate the shipping address fields on the checkout page automatically. This eliminates manual entry for the customer and reduces the risk of errors.

**What is Reverse Geocoding?**

Reverse geocoding translates a location or marker on the map into a human-readable address. In simpler terms, it takes a set of coordinates (like latitude and longitude) and tells you the corresponding street address. Therefore, this plugin is also referred to as a reverse geocoding plugin.

**How does it work?**

This pick address from google map plugin replaces it with a user-friendly map during checkout. Customers pick their location on the map, and the address auto-fills for a faster, smoother checkout.

The premium version lets them save multiple addresses for even quicker future use.

**How does it benefit?**

This woocommerce map to address plugin offers faster checkouts by allowing customers to select their location on a map, saving time and potentially reducing abandoned carts. It also reduces errors by automatically filling in the address based on the map location, ensuring accurate deliveries. Additionally, it improves convenience by providing a user-friendly interface, especially beneficial for mobile users, and adds an engaging element to the checkout experience with interactive map interaction.

**Note:** This plugin won't work with blocked checkout.Works on classic checkout
